This is a simple boilerplate for creating react application with rollup to start just run.
<code>
npm run build-dev
</code>

It will generate output.js inside public folder and you can test this through index.html in the public folder.

Also running above script will watch any file changes inside src folder so add your compnenets <u> ( Functional - Container ) </u> and see the result immediatly.


When you finish and ready for production just run 

<code>
npm run build-production
</code>


Also to run test use this script 

<code>
npm run test
</code>
